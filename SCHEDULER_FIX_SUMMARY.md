# Scheduler Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The scheduler was failing every single scheduled run with the error:
```
[ERROR] Error in scheduled scraper run: run_scraper() got an unexpected keyword argument 'config_file'
```

## Root Cause
In `workday_scraper/scheduler.py` line 143, the scheduler was calling:
```python
await run_scraper(config_file=config_file)
```

However, the `run_scraper` function in `scraper_controller.py` expects a dictionary argument:
```python
async def run_scraper(args):
```

## Fix Implemented
Updated the scheduler call to pass the correct argument structure:

```python
# Create the arguments dictionary that run_scraper expects
args = {
    "file": config_file,
    "initial": False,  # Don't scrape all jobs, just new ones
    "json": False,     # Don't output JSON
    "rss": False,      # Don't output RSS
    "max_workers": int(os.environ.get("MAX_WORKERS", "5")),
    "max_sessions": int(os.environ.get("MAX_SESSIONS", "3")),
    "chunk_size": int(os.environ.get("CHUNK_SIZE", "10")),
    "log_file": log_file,
    "log_level": os.environ.get("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO"),
    "db_file": db_file,
    "no_headless": True,  # Always run headless in scheduled mode
    "email": os.environ.get("EMAIL_SENDER"),
    "password": os.environ.get("EMAIL_PASSWORD"),
    "recipients": os.environ.get("EMAIL_RECIPIENTS")
}

await run_scraper(args)
```

## Improvements Made
1. **Fixed function signature mismatch** - Now passes dictionary instead of keyword argument
2. **Added environment variable support** - Configuration can be controlled via environment variables
3. **Improved Docker compatibility** - Automatically detects Docker environment and sets appropriate paths
4. **Better error handling** - More robust configuration with fallback defaults

## Testing
Created and ran a test script that validated the fix works correctly. The test confirmed:
- ✅ All required arguments are present
- ✅ Function call signature matches expectations
- ✅ Environment variables are properly handled

## Expected Result
The scheduler should now successfully run automated scrapes instead of failing daily with the argument error. The next scheduled run should complete without the previous error.

## Files Modified
- `workday_scraper/scheduler.py` - Fixed the run_scraper function call
