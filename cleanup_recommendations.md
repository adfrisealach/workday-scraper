# Cleanup Recommendations

After implementing the Telegram bot with enhanced job search functionality, the following files may no longer be needed or could be consolidated:

## Files to Consider Removing

### 1. location_transformation.py
- Contains Jupyter notebook-style code snippets for location parsing
- Redundant with the proper implementation in `location_field_parsing.py`
- Not formatted as a proper Python module
- Appears to be documentation/examples rather than functional code

### 2. simple_test.py
- Basic test script that checks environment setup
- Tests if database and config files exist
- Checks if environment variables are set
- Verifies required Python modules are installed
- Less comprehensive than `test_telegram_bot.py`

## Files to Consider Keeping But Review

### 1. test_telegram_bot.py
- More comprehensive test script for the Telegram bot
- Tests database queries used by the bot
- Tests location parsing functionality
- Doesn't make actual Telegram API calls
- Useful for development and debugging

### 2. location_field_parsing.py
- Contains proper Python module implementation for location parsing
- Includes functions that could be useful for data analysis
- Has more comprehensive location parsing than what's in the Telegram bot
- Could be kept for future enhancements or data analysis needs

## Backup Recommendation

Before removing any files, consider:
1. Creating a backup of the repository
2. Moving files to an "archive" or "deprecated" folder instead of deleting them
3. Updating documentation to note any removed functionality

This allows for easy recovery if the files turn out to be needed later.
