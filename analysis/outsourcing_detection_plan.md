# Outsourcing Early Warning System - Analysis Plan

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Create a data-driven early warning system to detect potential US workforce reductions through offshore hiring pattern analysis.

**Context**: Following the February 27, 2025 layoffs, we suspect that increased hiring in Canada and India for engineering/data roles may serve as leading indicators for future US workforce reductions.

**Approach**: Enhance the existing `job_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook with outsourcing-focused analysis while leveraging already-implemented infrastructure.
